**Github Repository: https://github.com/jacob-barna/TripleJR**

**Authors:** Jeffrey Smith, Ronald Ramirez, Jacob Barna, Jill Lenz

**Team Name:** TripleJR

## Instructions
### A markdown report that includes the following:

Using security requirements, identify five assurance claims
Prepare a convincing argument in support of the claims. Document this argument using an assurance case for each of the claims.
Assess the alignment of the planned evidence with that available (or can be made available) from the OSS project. Highlight the gaps.
Link to your team GitHub repository that shows your internal project task assignments and collaborations to finish this task. Also, include a summary of your team reflection meeting. What issues occurred? What did you plan to change moving forward? 
Only one submission per team.

### Assurance Claim 1 - Shields component prevents unauthorized tracking.

#### Evidence For Claim 1

*Inside my Word Doc and will post into Git*

### Assurance Claim 2 - The browser provides adequate confidentiality of communications.

### Assurance Claim 3 - The built-in password manager prevents unauthorized access to data. 
### Assurance Claim 4 - The browser wallet sufficiently secures reward contributions.

#### Evidence 

As you can see, this claim states that the systems wallet rewards program will give the user full control over their ability to contribute to authors. It is important to note that the Brave wallet rewards program allows the user to help fund the content they love even when the browser is blocking advertisements. The Brave browser has a built in wallet that allows user to individually fund their account so they can support their favorite creators or simply get rewarded with Basic Attention Token (BATs). BATâ€™s are divided up based on the users attention, based on the sites they have visited. All of this is done anonymously, giving the user privacy and the ability to have full control over which creators they would like to support.

### Assurance Claim 5 - The browser minimizes malicious third-party extension.

### Summary of team reflection
As a team, we have collectively agreed that even though we have successfully completed all the project requirements as of now, we have had some ups and downs. We use Lucid chart for our diagrams, Discord and GitHub, and class time for our communication and collaboration. During the development of our proposal and use/misuse case development, GitHub collaboration was not used to the full potential or was slow to start. However, for the assurance assignment, there was better collaboration on GitHub and better use of the features. The slow start was due to all the communication via Discord. Collaboration from other sources could be moved from applications such as Discord and integrated into GitHub to track communication and collaboration better. During the assurance assignment, the creation of claims and rebuttals were underestimated and led to problems coming up with broad claims. However, after getting started with a strong initial claim, the team was able to develop the remaining claims with less trouble. The initial thought that claims had to be proved "true" turned out to be false, and with evidence, the claims could be proved "false" or not secure. We also will be using the professor's suggestions he mentioned, by utilizing the Github issue board to make comments on issues we are working on. This helps our team stay organized. Regarding the individual contributions, we are in an agreeance that everyone has been open to receiving responsibilities and successful at meeting the deadlines.
