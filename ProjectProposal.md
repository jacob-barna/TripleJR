### Project Proposal: 2-3 page markdown document that describes the following:  

* #### An open-source software project your team has chosen. From here on, it will be referred to as “software”. 
Our idea that we will be going with if everyone is okay with this.
https://github.com/brave/brave-browser

* #### An assumed/hypothetical operational environment (e.g., home, office, enterprise, bank, government, etc.) where the users will expect security functionality from the software in its intended use.  

This browser is intended to provide privacy, security, and an alternative approach to monetizing the web.  Because of the wide adoption of standard browsers, with "other" browsers sharing just 3.5% of the world-wide marketshare [1], the current target market appears to be privacy-minded users who will use the browser at home, on their mobile devices, or at work if permitted.  These users ...

* #### What are the security needs of users from this software in its intended threat environment ? If there are none or very few, then re-evaluate your selection.  
The security needs 

* #### Develop a list of security features in the software. Again, if there are none or very few, then re-evaluate your choice.



* #### Motivation for selecting this project .   
As information technology students, we have seen many digital advancements in technology. We are living in an era where our online data is being sold to companies to promote products and target specific content to us, the users. Security and privacy are characteristics we value highly, and hope companies hold their promises when saying they do so as well. However, trusting companies becomes more difficult for us to do. Previous outbreaks which include tech conglomerates such as Facebook, were fined $5 billion for violating consumers’ privacy rights. [source here ] Finding solutions to keep our privacy and security as we utilize technology and different online outlets is something we strive to do.  

A solution that users could look into, happens to be an open source web called Brave. The Brave browser allows users to enjoy private, secure and fast browsing. Our group is determined to conduct an analysis on this application throughout the semester and determine whether the Brave application holds up to their security features they present.
