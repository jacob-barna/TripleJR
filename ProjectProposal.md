### Project Proposal: 2-3 page markdown document that describes the following:  

* An open-source software project your team has chosen. From here on, it will be referred to as “software”.  
* An assumed/hypothetical operational environment (e.g., home, office, enterprise, bank, government, etc.) where the users will expect security functionality from the software in its intended use.  
* What are the security needs of users from this software in its intended threat environment ? If there are none or very few, then re-evaluate your selection.  
* Develop a list of security features in the software. Again, if there are none or very few, then re-evaluate your choice.
* Motivation for selecting this project . 
* Open source project description (What is it?, Contributors, Activity, Use, Popularity, Languages used, platform, documentation sources, etc.) . 
* Discuss License, procedures for making contributions, and contributor agreements . 
* Summary of security-related history for the software (E.g., known vulnerabilities, security-related engineering decisions, security feature additions/removal, etc. ) . 
* Link to your team GitHub repository that shows your internal project task assignments and collaborations to finish this task.
