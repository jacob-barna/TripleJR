### Project Proposal: 2-3 page markdown document that describes the following:  

* An open-source software project your team has chosen. From here on, it will be referred to as “software”. 
Our idea that we will be going with if everyone is okay with this.
https://github.com/brave/brave-browser

* An assumed/hypothetical operational environment (e.g., home, office, enterprise, bank, government, etc.) where the users will expect security functionality from the software in its intended use.  
* What are the security needs of users from this software in its intended threat environment ? If there are none or very few, then re-evaluate your selection.  
* Develop a list of security features in the software. Again, if there are none or very few, then re-evaluate your choice.
* Motivation for selecting this project .
