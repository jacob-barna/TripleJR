Code analysis for Software Security Engineering: A markdown report that describes the following:

- A short summary of your code review strategy.
-- What challenges did you anticipate and how did your code review strategy attempt to address those challenges?
- Findings from manual code review of critical security functions identified in misuse cases, assurance cases and threat models.
- Findings from automated code scanning (if available). Include links to full reports.
- Summary of key findings from manual and/or automated scanning. This summary may include categorization, mappings to CWEs, CAPECs, Risk Levels, etc.
- Links to any pull requests, issues, discussion, etc. from the team to the original project and any follow-up interactions.
- Link to your team GitHub repository that shows your internal project task assignments and collaborations to finish this task. Also, include a summary of your team reflection meeting. What issues occurred? What did you plan to change moving forward?
